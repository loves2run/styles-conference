                        <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

                        <p>Workplace culture doesn&#8217t start with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, and it doesn&#8217t end with neckties, PCs, or big corporations. It&#8217s the unwritten rules, behavior, beliefs, and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it&#8217s what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and for designers to feel valued, we need to work in a culture that embraces design and allows it to succeed.</p>

                        <p>In Aaron&#8217s session he will explore how to recognize the traits of organizations that *get* design, both large and small. He will share what those teams, departments, and companies have that others don&#8217t, and more importantly, how to begin to change your own workplace&#8217s culture. Once you&#8217ve worked within a culture of design it&#8217s almost impossible to imagine yourself anywhere else.</p>

                        <h5>About Aaron</h5>

                        <p>Aaron Irizarry is a Senior Product Designer for Nasdaq OMX, a lover of heavy metal, a foodie, and a master of BBQ arts. You can find some of his thoughts and presentations on the conversation surrounding design over at discussingdesign.com.</p>

                        <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration From Filmakers</h5>

                        <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only with a combination of well-written narrative and effective storytelling technique. It&#8217s the filmmaker&#8217s job to put this together. To do so they&#8217ve developed processes, tools and techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise a well-told story.</p>

                        <p>With this workshop, we&#8217ll revisit the topic of using stories in design and expand on the technical aspects used in film to communicate. We&#8217ll look at some tools used in film, such as cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We&#8217ll consider why they&#8217re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.</p>

                        <h5>About Adam</h5>

                        <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate about collaboration, communication, creativity and storytelling. As an Experience Design Director with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ years of experience in interaction and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to create effective and easy-to-use digital products and services.
